## Issues & Suggested Fixes

-   **Network errors:**
    -   API calls to localhost fail in test environment (jsdom). Mock API responses for more robust tests.
-   **Deprecation warnings:**
    -   React Router v7 warnings are informational and do not affect test results.

## Next Steps

-   For more precise tests, add `data-testid` attributes to unique elements in your page components and target those in your tests.
-   Mock API calls for pages that depend on backend data.
